# Clima

It's a weather app that works with API from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/current). You can get simple weather data by inserting the city name or press the location button on the top left to get the current location weather data, but you have to allow this app to access your
current location first.

## Requirement

You have to replace the value of the "APIKey" key inside the **Keys.plist** file with your own API key from OpenWeather in order to successfully run the app.

*This app was initiated by **Dr. Angela Yu** from the London App Brewery.*
